project to your workspace, using the included launch configurations to run
some of the test suites. Alternatively, you can right-click on a test suite
or the whole project and select "Run As > JUnit Test".

If you want to generate a signed bundle so it can be uploaded to the OSS
Sonatype repository, you will need to run:

mvn clean package gpg:sign repository:bundle-create

You will need to enter the passphrase for your private GPG key at some point.
Please do not forget to distribute it to hkp://pgp.mit.edu if the signed
bundle is to be accepted in Maven Central!


to deploy to sonatype:

mvn -P sonatype-deploy -Dgpg.passphrase=X

where X=your gpg password
